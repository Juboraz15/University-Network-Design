Basic Network Design using Cisco Packet Tracer

The project primarily focused on designing a structured network and assigning IP addresses to each host within the different departments of the university.

* The university network was divided into multiple departments, each assigned its own subnet for efficient network segmentation.
* VLSM was utilized to optimize IP address allocation and minimize IP wastage.
* EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) was implemented as the preferred dynamic routing protocol, ensuring efficient routing, scalability.
* A single HTTP, DHCP, and DNS server was deployed to centralize web services, dynamic IP address allocation, and domain name resolution across the entire network.

This approach ensured a well-structured, efficient, and scalable network for the given project.
